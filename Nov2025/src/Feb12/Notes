how hashmap is created or stored
--- Arraylist of linkedlist

map.put()
-generates the hashcode for the element to be put
-calculate the index with modulo function
- checks for the hashcode in teh index
-if present checks for key
--if same key then replaces value
-- if diff key then add another node
-if not present adds new node with key and value


equals and hashcode contract should be overriden
- if two hashcodes are equal then objects should be equal
-it two objects are not equal they may/may not have same hashcodes
-Hashcode should be consistent given obj does not change

arraylist - not threadsafe use copyonwrite, copyonread


Java 8
-Functional interfaces
-Lambdas
-Stream API
-Optional class
-Date time API
-Default methods in interface
-:: operator

--Interface -- contract which class has to full fill

functional interface - interface which have only one abstract method SAM - single abstract method
-can have static method concrete method(which has body)
-can have variables - all variables are by default public static and final
-It can have default method - which is for backward compatibility
-No constructor
-No object can be created
so we need to create a class which implements this interface and use it
since no constructor - no obj.

If the class implements two interfaces which has same method- this is called dynamic problem

If we want to use the method from an interface and dont want to create a class - we can do that by anonymous inner class
to further make it easier we can just use lambda function



---Lambda
-It can be only of SAM
-It is used to express the instance of the functional interface
