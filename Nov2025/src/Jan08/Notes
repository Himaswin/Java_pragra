Branch -> It is an independent line of development. it is a separate workplace created from existing code
Develop new features, fix bugs, release safely without breaking the production



Branching strategy

you have a development branch
if ticket is raised
you need to create a branch
fix the bug
merge the branch to the developement branch

when you finishe resolving the bug you need to do pr then
someone verifies they approve the pr then code goes to branch
if didnt approve then if there any comments make changes then pr again

PR(pull request)

regression testing is the new functionality working properly and not interupting existing code

Back merge

3 branching strategy
main-> release-> develop-> branches(for features)

Release Management

Hotfix -> you have a bug product wants to be fixed asap
you will create a hotfix branch from the main branch and fix the bug and then merge
the same changes to release as well as develop branch and at the same time you will promote the changes to the prod.

Hotfix branches from the main not the lower levels since the prod has main 


git pull -> it is used to get the latest code from the remote to the local
pull request -> it is used create a request to merge one branch to another. Review protected
push-> to push your local branch change to the remote branch repo
merge-> merge one branch to another
merge conflict


git branch -> to check the branches
git brnach branchname -> to createa new branch with brachname
git checkout -b branchname -> create a new branch with BranchName and chekout to that branch
git branch -D branchname to delete the branch -> make sure to be outside of the branch which one is deleting

git checkout branchname -> change to the branchname branch

different env and 1 more branching strategy
release management
