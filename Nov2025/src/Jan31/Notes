how to create an immutable class ? var private and final, class final, no setters

Collection -  framework to manipulate and store group of objects

arraylist is immutable? syncronized ? - mutable, not syncronized, not threadsafe
stringbuffer threadsafe and syncronized


we should not use arraylist for manipulation.
search intensive(indexes) get(10)

Time complexity
BigO notation

for manipulation use linkedlist
LinkedList-> we store as nodes which store element and points to next node
Tail stores the address of the next node
head start node
last node points to null

Types -> singly linked list, doubly, circular
-non continguos


        arraylist       linkedlist
search      O(1)           O(n)
insert      O(n)            O(1)(at the head/tail, or when we know where to insert)

why iterator when we have for loop
concurrent modification exception

There is something called modcount internally
if we use iterator it stores and updates the mode count
so we can add and remove
without this using simple for loop doesnt change or update the modcount
so it throws a concurrentModification excepiton


Serialization
serialization converts an objects state into a byte stream, allowing it to be reverted back into a copy of the object via deserialization
-jvm independent
-essential for cross-process persistence, trnasport
-used for cached snapshot
-sending message payloads
-file storage

core apis ObjectOutputStream - ObjectInputStream

class A and class B
class A implements serialize
class B extends from class A
since A is serialized all the properties are in B

if i dont want to serizlization in B what to do?
-> one make every vairable transient(transient variables cannot be serialized)
-> writeObject and readObject from serialize can be changed with different exceptions

Garbage collection
-process of cleaning obj from the heap memory
automatic in c, c++
-developer can suggest to JVm to run GC
-when there is no reference to an object

why GC
-prevents memory leaks
-No manual memory management
-Dynamic memory allocation
-Better performance
-Memory optimization

When GC
-runs automatically by JVM
-occurs when the JVM detects low memory
-Programmers cannot force it directly
-Request can be made using System.gc()
-Final decision will be taken by JVM

-GC helps prevent memory leaks and OutOfMemoryError
-MemoryLeak

Memory areas
Heap - Stack
GC is based on heap since obj are stored in heaps
