String and ways to create a string
Stringbuilder - buffer
Inheritance

string vs string builder vs string buffer
StringBuilder is faster than stringBuffer because stringBuffer is thread safe i.e syncronized



== compares memory reference
.equals() compares content

new-> heap
Literal-> string constant pool
why string is immutable? -> memory, string pool security, performace

Inheritence
we cannot inherit the constructor from other class
we use constructor to initialize the class

Object class is the parent class of all objects

this refers to current object
===========================================================

Polymorphism
many forms, many behaviours
ability of the method to change based on requirements

types of polymorphism
compiletime, static polymorphism/loading, method overloading
runtime, dynamic loading, method overriding



Method overloading - same method name and different parameters

static binding


- Method Overriding-> own functionality, same method name different implementation
give @Override for annotation
using the method from main class and using it differently in current method
At the run time and based on the object it will evaluate which method is called

In method overriding, it always look first in the child then goes to parent class

payment- credit, debit, cheque, upi
employee- full-time, part-time
Area-> square, rectangle, circle, triangle
