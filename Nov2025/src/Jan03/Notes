2d arrays
static -var, method, blocks
stack - heap

#this
it refers to the current object


#string
sequence of characters
non primitive data type
stored in heap
string constant pool

if we have 2 variables to pointing the same string
then in memory(heap) scp only one string exists

properties
strings are immutable (cannot be changed)
string s = "abc";
s = "bc"; now although s is changed but in scp abc still exists
just the reference of s is changed to bc(new memory is created here )

immutable because "abc" still exists in heap memory(scp)
it will be used by other variables using the same value
if no variable is used then it will be moved or removed by garbage collection (imp in java)

methods in string
length
toLowerCase
toUpperCase
split
substring
concat
charAt
equals-> to check value
== to check the reference i.e whether their memory is same
trim to remove all the spaces before and after the string


how to create a string
String literal
new keyword


Stringbuilder - Stringbuffer
These are mutable

StringBuilder is non thread safe but fast
StringBuffer is thread safe- slow

String vs Stringbuffer vs string builder
string is slowest among all -- very slow


thread is smallest workable unit

-OOPs
Inheritance-> inherites properties(Attributes, methods) from another class
Encapsulation-> Bundling of data and methods in a single unit
Abstraction-> hiding the implementation details and showing necessary features only
Polymorphism->many forms -> ability of a method to behave differently method overloading, method overriding



Inheritance is used to reuse the code

Employee-> parent class/super class
 |
 |extends
Manager -> child class/sub class

create a vehicle class create car or truck or bus class and inherit the properties


Types of inheritance
-single level inheritance
-multi level inheritance
-Hierichal
-multiple[Not allowed in java]-> diamond problem
