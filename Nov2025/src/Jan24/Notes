what is exception?-> disrupts the normal
throwable is parent class of exception
finally? -> always executed unless intentially exit the code

5 keywords to handle exceptions -> try catch finally throw and throws

throw -> when we want to throw an exception explicitly
throws-> when you want to delegate the responsiblity of the exception handling to someone else.

try catch should be where the program is executing not in the method itself

custom exception must be an instance of throwable
after throw, code stops

try with resource - try with finally do the same thing

you dont have to close the resource try(openfile/scanner/connection to db){}

throw vs throws?
final vs finalize?
string vs stringbuilder vs stringbuffer

collection -> framework to store and manipulate group of objects

List            Set         Queue       Map
ArrayList
LinkedList
- It provides various methods to work on
collection works only with objects. no primitive data type can be used
non-primitive - strings, classes, arrays

wrapper class
int ----> Integer
double -------> Double
float ----------> Float

AutoBoxing -> primitive to wrapper
Unboxing -> wrapper to primitive

Type casting
Widening casting -> smaller type to larger type ->byte--short--char--int--long--float--double
Narrowing Casting -> larger type to smaller size type-> double--float--long--int--char--short--byte

Java is type safe language
js, python not type safe
