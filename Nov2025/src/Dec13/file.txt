why java is oop?
blueprint - design to create, map, skeleton, basic structure
class is a blueprint to create objects
object ->instance of a class


-- Data members/ variables/attributes
new -- allocates memory in jvm


behavior ->method/function

cannot declare a method inside a method

instance var - belongs to the class and any method in class can access it
local var - limited scope and cannot be accessed outside its scope

String[] args can accept any number of arguments of type string;

arrays - storing variables of similar kind
