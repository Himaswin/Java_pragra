Branch - is independant line of dev, separate workspace from main

.gitignore
-tells which files to ignore(not to track)
-logs
-build files
-compiled code

pr? to merge changes to another branch we make a pr then changes are approved by someone assigned

clone
pull vs fetch
fetch-> download the changes only
pull-> fetch + merge ( might cause merge conflit)

what happens when the code is pushed to github?
Deployment

github ----------------------server--------------------www.abc.com


jvm-> take care of memory and compilation
javac -> compile the code


platform independent? because of bytecode
student.java------------java compiler(javac)------------>Student.class(bytecode)--------->JVM

java is both compiled and interpreted

Jdk-> java dev kit(jre+jvm)

.jar-> java archive this is enough to execute all java classes

Maven->automation build tools ->--used to convert java files to .jar

.jar is deployed on any server but that server should have java on it

CI/CD-> Continuos integration/Continuos deployment/develivery

Jenkins-> CI/CD --> opensouce automation server used to implement CI/Cd pipelines

CI-> Developers frequently integrate code in  to the shared repo.
-code is pushed multiple times a day
-automatic build triggered
-automatic test runs

CD-> code is always in deployable state
build+test+package
manual approval for production

jenkin file
Every task is known as job in jenkins
