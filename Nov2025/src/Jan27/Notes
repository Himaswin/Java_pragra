throw vs throws
throw - actually throws exception
throws - just declares and to be handled.

generics?
Type safety, No class cast exception at runtime


Immutability-> An object whose state cannot be changed after creation
String
final class - immutable class
 -need to have data members as final to make it completely final
 - no setter methods


Collection-> It is a framework to manipulate and store different types of objects
It is set of interfaces and classes to store and manipulate group of objects
Objects(wrapper classes), Generics

throwable(parent)-> exception
Interface -- contract that a class follows
doesnt show implementation- tells what class must do not how it does

                                Iterable-Interface
                                    |
                                Collection-Interface
                                    |
       List-Interface             Set-Interface                     Queue-Interface
       ArrayList                  HashSet                              Deque, PriorityQueue
        LinkedList, Stack         LinkedHashSet, TreeSet


ArrayList-> it is dynamic nature, size can be changed automatically

Java 7
by default list of 10 size will be created
100% capacity then it will grow to 16
n+ n/2 + 1 = 10+5+1 = 16 it grows using this formula

Java 8
Initially the size is 0
- then automatically grows to 10
-just to avoid memory waste

-> arrayList is continuoes memory location - first at loc 12, next would be at 13, 14 ....
- this makes search operation faster
array has length
arraylist -> size and capacity
by default value for wrapper -> Integer - Null
for int its 0;


Manipulation in arraylist is costly, adding and removing element frequently.
-costs memory and time
1 million elements
10, 23, 33, 45 .........
adding at 2nd index everythng from 3rd element should be moved back

100 elements to be stored .... array or arraylist(array is faster)

Loop over collections
Iterator-> object which is used to iterate over the element of collections
